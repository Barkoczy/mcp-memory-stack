## üí° Key Insights

### Why Vector Search?
Traditional keyword search can't understand meaning and context. Vector search represents text as high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning, enabling AI systems to find relevant information even when exact words don't match.

### Why MCP Protocol?
The Model Context Protocol provides a standardized way for AI models to access external memory systems. This creates interoperability between different AI tools and memory providers.

### Why This Architecture?
Our modular architecture separates concerns while maintaining performance. PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance and mature tooling, while pgvector adds efficient vector operations. Node.js enables high concurrency for API workloads.
