## Release Process

### Version Management

#### Semantic Versioning
- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes, API changes
- **Minor (0.X.0)**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes, security patches

#### Version Bump Commands
```bash
# Patch release (bug fixes)
npm version patch

# Minor release (new features)
npm version minor

# Major release (breaking changes)
npm version major

# Pre-release versions
npm version prerelease --preid=beta
npm version prerelease --preid=alpha
```

### 1. Prepare Release Branch
```bash
# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v2.1.0
git push -u origin release/v2.1.0

# Update version
npm version minor --no-git-tag-version

# Update CHANGELOG.md
# Add release notes and migration guides
```

### 2. Pre-Release Testing
```bash
# Build and test Docker images
docker-compose build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

# Run full test suite
npm run test:full

# Security scan
npm audit --audit-level moderate
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/workspace securecodewarrior/docker-scan

# Performance testing
npm run test:performance
```

### 3. Create Release
```bash
# Tag release
git tag -a v2.1.0 -m "Release version 2.1.0"
git push origin v2.1.0

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# - Run CI/CD pipeline
# - Create GitHub release
# - Build and publish Docker images
# - Generate release notes
```

### 4. Deployment Verification
- [ ] Staging deployment successful
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] API endpoints functional
- [ ] Database connectivity verified
- [ ] SSL certificates valid
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

## Post-Release Tasks

### 1. Production Deployment
```bash
# Pull latest images
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull

# Deploy with zero downtime
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --no-deps mcp-memory

# Verify deployment
curl https://yourdomain.com/health
```

### 2. Monitoring
- [ ] Application metrics normal
- [ ] Error rates within acceptable limits
- [ ] Response times acceptable
- [ ] Resource usage normal
- [ ] Log levels appropriate

### 3. Communication
- [ ] Release notes published
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Community notified
- [ ] Support team informed
- [ ] Known issues documented

### 4. Rollback Plan
```bash
# Emergency rollback procedure
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --scale mcp-memory=0
# Deploy previous version
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## Release Types

### Hotfix Releases
For critical security patches or production-breaking bugs:

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/v2.0.1

# Make minimal changes
# Update version
npm version patch

# Fast-track testing
npm run test:critical

# Tag and release
git tag -a v2.0.1 -m "Hotfix version 2.0.1"
git push origin v2.0.1
```

### Beta Releases
For testing new features:

```bash
# Create beta release
npm version prerelease --preid=beta

# Tag as pre-release
git tag -a v2.1.0-beta.1 -m "Beta version 2.1.0-beta.1"
git push origin v2.1.0-beta.1

# GitHub release marked as pre-release
# Limited deployment to beta environment
```

### Major Releases
For breaking changes:

1. **Migration Guide**: Detailed upgrade instructions
2. **Deprecation Notices**: Advance warning for breaking changes
3. **Compatibility Matrix**: Supported versions and dependencies
4. **Extended Testing**: Additional integration and compatibility testing
5. **Gradual Rollout**: Phased deployment strategy

## Environment-Specific Considerations

### Development
- [ ] Feature branches tested
- [ ] Local development environment functional
- [ ] Debug configurations available

### Staging
- [ ] Production-like configuration
- [ ] Full integration testing
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing

### Production
- [ ] High availability configuration
- [ ] Backup and recovery tested
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting active
- [ ] Security hardening applied
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan ready

## Release Automation

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Create Release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        # ... release automation
```

### Docker Image Publishing
```bash
# Automated in GitHub Actions
docker build -t mcp-memory-stack:latest .
docker tag mcp-memory-stack:latest mcp-memory-stack:v2.1.0
docker push mcp-memory-stack:latest
docker push mcp-memory-stack:v2.1.0
```

## Quality Gates
